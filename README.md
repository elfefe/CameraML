## 📷 CameraML

**CameraML** is a Python-based application for detecting user movement. It allows you to move and click the mouse remotely on the screen using your bare hands.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Real‑time video capture** from webcam or camera module
* **Machine‑learning inference** on each frame (e.g. object detection, classification)
* **Lightweight Python backend**, minimal dependencies
* **Extensible architecture** for plugging in new models and processing pipelines

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on model)
* Flask (if web interface is provided)
* Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
